This simulation is done to generate the spectrum from a x ray tube with a tungsten anode.
The tube is simulated using a particle gun that shoots mono-energetic electrons (of 35 keV) onto a tungsten block.
A volume placed close to the tungsten block is used to record the x rays that happen to travel through it.
The physics library used is Penelope since it has been shown (Geant4 Simulation of a filtered X-ray Source for Radiation Damare Studies, M. Guthoff, KIT) that it can reproduce the x ray spectra of a x ray tube.

The classes implemented in the simulation are the following:

StoreData:
This class is used to store the x ray spectrum, it contains one histogram and produces one root file.
There must be only one instance of the class for each run.

DetectorConstruction:
The class contains all the details concerning the detector geometry.

RunAction:
The methods of this class are called at the start and end of every run.
At the begin of a run a seed is created for the random engine used in the simulation and the instance of StoreData initialized.
At the end of the run the method of StoreData to write the root file is called and the StoreData instance is erased.

EventAction:
The methods of this class are called at the begin and end of every event.
An event starts with the generation of a primary particle and ends when the daughters have been finished to propagate.
The methods of this class are just used to print out the event number.

SteppingAction:
The methods of this class are called at every step of the propagation of a particle.
A step starts with the interaction of a particle and ends with another.
The crossing of a volume boundary is considered in the case as an interaction.
The SteppingAction class methods are used to determine whether a gamma passes through the volume used to register the x ray spectrum.
When a gamma passes in the volume its energy is recorded in the histogram of the StoreData class.

PrimaryGeneratorAction:
This class contains the definition of the particle gun used in the simulation.
The method for the generation of a particle is called at the beginning of each event.

PhysicsList:
In this class are specified the particles used in the simulation and the physics of their interaction.
The physics is from the Penelope library that contains electromagnetic phenomena.
All the possible particles have been initialized in order to avoid errors while running the program.

Further development:
In order to make the simulation more close to our setup conditions the following improvements are possible:
-define the geometry in a more realistic way (rotation angle of the tungsten block and placement of the volume used to record the x rays)
-implement a spatial distribution of the particle hitting the tungsten (moving the particle gun around)
-implement a smearing in the energy of the electron beam schooled at the tungsten
-all the classes necessary to make the simulation parameters steerable with macros have been omitted in order to speed up the development, an implementation of these classes would result in a big improvement in flexibility of the code
